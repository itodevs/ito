# Ito

Ito is immersive teleoperation software built entirely for piloting robots.

Most teleoperation software treats the pilot experience as secondary. It is
usually a basic tool for collecting demonstrations and training robot policies.
Ito takes a different approach: it is not designed to train AI. Its sole purpose
is to make remotely operating a robot comfortable for the human pilot.

We envision a future where people pilot every type of robot from their home or
office. This could enable disabled people to act through robots in places their
bodies cannot easily take them, and allow people to explore or work in
environments that are hostile to humans.

Ito is intended to support humanoids, droids, vehicles, mechas, and robot forms
that do not fit an existing category. It translates the pilot's tracked pose and
controller input into control instructions appropriate to the piloted robot.
In the other direction, it translates the robot's sensor input into a
comfortable immersive 3D reconstruction of its surroundings.

## Codebase

Ito is being reset around the v1 design in `docs/v1.md`. Protocol seams are
documented in `docs/protocol.md`, and architectural decisions are recorded in
`docs/adr/`. Local Docker Compose operation is documented in
`docs/local-v1.md`, and the current v1 acceptance record is in
`docs/acceptance-v1.md`.

The main source directories are:

- `server/`: Ito Server code.
- `server/processors`: 3D reconstruction algorithms, applied.
- `client/`: WebXR Pilot Client code.
- `drivers/`: robot-side drivers and robot reference material.
- `docs/`: design notes, protocol notes, and architectural decisions.
